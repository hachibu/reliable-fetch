# Reliable Fetch

An easy-to-use library for Node.js to make the fetch function more reliable.

This library is currently under development and should be considered incomplete and a work in progress.

**[ðŸ“¦ NPM Package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@hachibu/reliable-fetch)**

**[ðŸ“– Documentation](https://hachibu.github.io/reliable-fetch)**

**[ðŸ’» Examples](examples)**

**ðŸ’¡ Goals**

-   Unify reliability functions from multiple libraries into a single library.
-   Design a [fluent API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluent_interface) that allows users to easily discover and compose reliability functions.

**âœ¨ Features**

-   Timeout
-   Circuit breaker
-   Retry with linear and exponential backoff
-   Request hedging
-   Random chaos
